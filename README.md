# Pulse-oximeter

Project is made from 3 parts: backend, frontend and ESP8266 software. Backend is made in ASP.NET using clean architecture. It also uses Entity Framewrok Core and Identity framework for security of users data. Database is created in Microsoft SQL Server. Frontend is made in Angular with use of Angular Material and chart.js. ESP8266 software is created in PlatformIO extension to Visual Studio Code. Unfortunately due to hardware defect frontend part has been erased.

Applications let user send results of measurements from pulse oximeter to account. The ESP8266 part is responsible for managing data from sensor and sending it when WiFi is available or saving it in flash memory until WiFi connecton will be establshed. It also shows current results on scrren which is part of device. When data is send to backend, it saves results in database. For now it isn't linked with any user. User can add results to account by logging into account on website and there in results tab he can add new measurements from his devices. If it is first measurement user have add device by submitting WiFi credentials from which the data was send. After adding results to account user is able to see every result in table or graph.
